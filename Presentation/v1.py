AI Market Summary for 2025 and Predictions for 2026 — Bullet-Point Version
1. Key Developments in AI in 2025
1.1 Specialization of AI Models

Shift from general-purpose LLMs to highly specialized, domain-focused models.

Creation of private, organization-specific models trained on internal data.

Increased emphasis on privacy, compliance, and data control.

1.2 Rise of AI Agents

AI systems became capable of multi-step task execution.

Agents performed end-to-end workflows such as coding, data analysis, DevOps tasks, sales operations, and content production.

AI moved from “assistive tool” to “operational collaborator.”

1.3 Multimodality Became Standard

Unified processing of text, images, audio, video, and code.

Realistic video and audio generation made creative pipelines much faster.

Practical workflows emerged: “text → working prototype,” “scenario → full video.”

1.4 Integration of AI Into Everyday Business Operations

Automation of repetitive and operational tasks across departments.

Engineering teams used AI for documentation, debugging, testing, and log analysis.

AI became embedded in CRM, BI, analytics, marketing, HR, and customer support.

1.5 Regulation and Ethical Focus

Companies adopted stricter governance frameworks.

Efforts increased around model transparency, auditability, and data origin tracking.

Regulatory bodies began setting clearer expectations for AI safety and fairness.
