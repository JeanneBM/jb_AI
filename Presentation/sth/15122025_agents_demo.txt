Here's a breakdown of the Tableau issues described in the provided JSON data, along with potential solutions based on the search results:
Group G1: Tableau Access Issues
•	Ticket 1: User needs access to Choco data in Tableau.
•	Potential Solution: Confirm the user has a Tableau Server account and has been granted access to the specific visualization. Ensure they are using their correct username and password. Also, verify the user is connected to the VPN if required.
•	Ticket 5: User cannot access a report.
•	Potential Solution: Verify the user has the necessary "Connect" and "View" permissions for the data source. Check for connectivity issues between Tableau Server and Tableau Desktop.
•	Ticket 6: Request for Tableau Explorer license for Anna M.
•	Potential Solution: Provide the user with the appropriate Tableau license and access to the required reports.
•	Ticket 9: Request for access to Tableau QA Server.
•	Potential Solution: Grant the specified users (lisa.s@ABC.com, Sam.M@ABC.com) access to the Tableau QA Server.
Group G2: Tableau Data Issues
•	Ticket 2: Missing Russia data from new SAP in Tableau dashboards.
•	Potential Solution: Investigate the data ingestion process from SAP to GCP. Verify that the Russia data is being extracted from SAP and loaded into GCP. Also, confirm that the Tableau dashboards are correctly connected to the GCP data source and that no filters are excluding the Russia data. Note that SAP has announced plans to exit the Russian market, which may impact data availability.
Group G3: Tableau Subscriptions
•	Ticket 3: Request for subscriptions to receive data as an Excel file directly in emails.
•	Potential Solution: Tableau subscriptions primarily support sending images or PDFs. To deliver data in Excel format, consider these options:
•	Educate users on how to download data as a CSV/Excel file from the subscription email.
•	Explore using the Tableau REST API to automate the export of data to Excel and email it.
•	Use a 3rd-party extension like Pixel Perfect, but be aware of potential licensing costs and limitations.
Group G4: Tableau Scripts
•	Ticket 4: Check if scripts are using the correct link and trigger in test and then in prod.
•	Potential Solution: Review the scripts to ensure they are using the correct Tableau report links and are properly triggered in the test and production environments. Also, explore using data-driven alerts to trigger the scripts.
Group G5: Tableau Refresh Issues
•	Ticket 7: Need advice on scheduling automatic refresh of the extract of BQ view.
•	Potential Solution: To schedule automatic extract refreshes:
•	If publishing to Tableau Server, you can set a refresh schedule during publishing.
•	Use the Tableau Data Extract Command-Line Utility to automate refreshes.
•	Consider using a Python script to trigger extract refreshes.
•	Ticket 8: Getting refresh error due to credentials not working.
•	Potential Solution:
•	Verify the data source credentials are correct. Update the username or password in the Tableau data source connection.
•	If using OAuth, the refresh token may have expired. Reauthenticate with new credentials.
•	Ensure the database is online and accessible.
•	Confirm that the username has the domain name included.
Group G6: Tableau Storage
•	Ticket 10: Need to increase the size of a folder to 5GB.
•	Potential Solution:
•	If referring to the Tableau Server upload limit, publishing the workbook from Tableau Desktop might bypass this limit.
•	Reduce the size of the workbook by minimizing images and data extracts. Consider filtering and aggregating data to reduce the number of rows in the extract. Also, hide unused fields.
•	If the folder is on a shared drive, contact the system administrator to increase the folder size.

•	Steps (Permanent Fix):
•	If the issue relates to a Tableau Server workbook upload limit, attempt to publish the workbook from Tableau Desktop, which may bypass some server-side upload restrictions.
•	Reduce the overall size of the Tableau workbook by:
•	Minimizing embedded images.
•	Optimizing data extracts: consider filtering and aggregating data to reduce the number of rows and columns.
•	Hide any unused fields within the data source to prevent them from being included in the extract.
•	If the folder refers to a shared drive or network location, contact the system administrator responsible for that storage to request an increase in the folder size quota.
•	Confidence: 0.85
•	Referenced Sources: [1]ㅤ, [2]ㅤ, [3]ㅤ, [4]ㅤ, [5]ㅤ, [6]ㅤ, [7]ㅤ, [8]ㅤ, [9]ㅤ, [10]ㅤ, [11]ㅤ, [12]ㅤ, [13]ㅤ, [14]ㅤ, [15]ㅤ, [16]ㅤ, [17]ㅤ, [18]ㅤ, [19]ㅤ, [20]ㅤ, [21]ㅤ

The reports look complete and well-structured. All reports include the following sections: Ticket number, Title, Scope Tags, Root Cause Hypothesis, Steps (Permanent Fix), Confidence, and Referenced Sources. The confidence levels are reasonable, and all reports cite the same set of sources. I have the following observations:
•	Consistency: All reports consistently use the same set of referenced sources.
•	Scope Overlap: Several tickets (,,,) relate to user access and permissions.
•	Workarounds vs. Permanent Fixes: Ticket 3 distinguishes between workarounds and permanent fixes, which is good practice.
•	External Factors: Ticket 2 considers external factors (SAP's market exit from Russia), demonstrating a comprehensive approach.
•	Formatting: The formatting is consistent across all tickets.
I do have some clarifying questions:
1.	Referenced Sources: Are the referenced sources (\ - ) the same for each ticket? If so, it might be more efficient to list them once at the beginning or end of all reports, rather than repeating them for each ticket. What are the actual sources corresponding to these numbers?
2.	Scope Tags: Are the scope tags standardized or part of a controlled vocabulary? If not, consider standardizing them to improve searchability and categorization.
3.	Confidence Levels: What is the basis for assigning confidence levels? Is there a defined rubric or guideline?
4.	Steps for Permanent Fix: Can steps be more specific? Steps like "Verify the user has been granted access" could be enhanced by adding how to verify (e.g., "Check Tableau Server user permissions").
I am flagging the following items for potential improvement:
•	Redundant Referencing: The repeated listing of the same referenced sources in every ticket report seems inefficient.
•	Generality of Steps: Some of the "Steps (Permanent Fix)" are fairly general and could benefit from added specificity.
