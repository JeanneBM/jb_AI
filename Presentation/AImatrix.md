AI Capability Matrix

AI Type	How It Works (In Short)

Chat AI	Prompt → instant text response
* Copilot (AI in tools)	Prompt → action in current context (document, email, code)
* Research AI	Prompt → multi-source analysis → structured report
* Agent AI (Task / Goal-Based)	Goal + context → step-by-step execution → delivered outcome
* Tool-Using / Plugin AI	AI decides when to call external tools or APIs
* Workflow / Automation AI	Trigger → rules + AI → automated action
* Multimodal AI	Combines text, images, audio, and video
* Voice AI	Speech ↔ text ↔ real-time voice response
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)	Query → knowledge base retrieval → grounded response
* Embedded / Invisible AI	Decisions made in the background without user prompts
* Recommendation AI	Behavior analysis → personalized suggestions
* Predictive / Forecasting AI	Historical data → future predictions
* Decision AI	Data + rules → automated decisions
* Generative Media AI	Prompt → image / video / audio generation
* Code AI	Code context → suggestions, generation, refactoring
* Evaluation / QA AI	Output → validation against rules or source of truth
* Autonomous AI Systems	Plans, executes, and self-corrects actions
