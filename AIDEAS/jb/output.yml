Here's a summary of potential solutions for the Tableau issues described in the provided JSON objects, based on the context from the knowledge base:

G1: Tableau Access Issues (Tickets 1, 6, 9)

User Access and Permissions: Verify the user has a Tableau Server account and has been granted access to the specific visualization. Confirm the correct AD username and password are being used. Ensure the user has the "Connect" permission for the data source.
Licensing: Confirm the user has the appropriate license (Creator, Explorer, or Viewer).
Network Connectivity: Check if the user is connected to the VPN if required. Ensure the network is secure and not a public Wi-Fi.
Firewall and Ports: Verify that firewall rules aren't blocking Tableau Server ports (80, 443, 8850).
Group Memberships: Misconfigured group memberships can cause access issues.
G2 & G7: Tableau Data Refresh Issues (Tickets 2, 8)

Credentials: Expired credentials or authentication errors are common causes. Ensure the service account used for data extraction has current passwords. Check for typos in usernames and passwords. If using OAuth, the refresh token may have expired.
Data Source Availability: Confirm the underlying database is online and accessible.
Network Latency: Evaluate network latency to the data source using ping or tracert.
Extract Refreshes: If using an extract, refresh it in Tableau Desktop. If the extract is not capturing changes, edit the connection and select the source file again.
Tableau Bridge: If using Tableau Bridge, troubleshoot related errors. Ensure the Bridge client is running and up to date.
Alerts: Check for alerts in Tableau Cloud indicating the reason for refresh failures.
Live Connection: Consider using a live connection instead of an extract for real-time data.
G3: Tableau Subscriptions as Excel (Ticket 3)

Tableau's Native Limitations: Tableau subscriptions natively support images and PDFs, not Excel.
Pixel Perfect Extension: Consider using the Pixel Perfect extension, but be aware of potential licensing costs.
Tabcmd or Tableau Server Client: Use Tabcmd or the Tableau Server Client (TSC) with a Python script to export data to CSV/Excel and email it.
Crosstab Visualization: Create a crosstab visualization and educate users on how to download it as a CSV/Excel file.
G4 & G6: Tableau Script and Trigger Issues (Tickets 4, 7)

Script Execution: To trigger a Python script from a Tableau dashboard, consider using TabPy.
Data-Driven Alerts: Use data-driven alerts to send an email and automate the Spark script from the server.
Webhooks: Webhooks can trigger actions based on Tableau events.
G5: Tableau Connection Issues (Ticket 5)

Connectivity Errors: Verify data source credentials and permissions.
Network Issues: Check firewall configurations and DNS settings.
Driver Compatibility: Ensure you have the latest database drivers installed.
Cache Corruption: Clear the Tableau Desktop cache.
Server Name and Port: Double check server name and port, and try again
Firewall Rules: Check if firewall rules are preventing connection to the Tableau Server.
G8: Tableau Folder Size Issue (Ticket 10)

Extracts: Extracts increase file size.
Images: Reduce or consolidate images in dashboards.
Hidden Fields: Hide unused fields to exclude them from extracts.
Data Aggregation and Filtering: Filter and aggregate data to reduce rows.
Shared Data Sources: Use shared data sources to avoid multiple copies of the same data.

Tags:
Tableau, Scripts, Automation, Triggers, Scheduled Refresh

Solutions:
Workaround:
Manual Report Triggering/Refresh: Manually trigger scripts or refresh extracts while investigating automated solutions.
Permanent Fix:
Priority: High (Confidence: 86%)

Integrate with TabPy for Script Execution:
To trigger Python scripts directly from a Tableau dashboard, consider integrating TabPy[4]ㅤ[6]ㅤ.
Implement Data-Driven Alerts:
Use Tableau's data-driven alerts to send emails and potentially automate external scripts (e.g., Spark scripts) from the server based on specific data conditions [4]ㅤ[6]ㅤ[7]ㅤ[8]ㅤ[14]ㅤ.
Utilize Webhooks for Event-Based Actions:
Configure webhooks to trigger external actions based on specific events within Tableau (e.g., extract refresh completion) [4]ㅤ[6]ㅤ.

Tags:
Tableau, Storage, Performance, Optimization

Solutions:
Workaround:
Temporary Manual Cleanup: Manually delete older or unnecessary extracts/workbooks from the folder if immediate space is needed.
Permanent Fix:
Priority: Medium (Confidence: 86%)

Optimize Extracts:
Reduce the size of Tableau extracts by filtering data to include only necessary information [10]ㅤ[15]ㅤ[16]ㅤ.
Reduce Image Footprint:
Minimize or consolidate images used within dashboards to decrease overall file size [10]ㅤ[15]ㅤ[16]ㅤ.
Hide Unused Fields:
Hide any unused fields from data sources to exclude them from extracts, thereby reducing size [10]ㅤ[15]ㅤ[16]ㅤ.
Aggregate and Filter Data:
Implement data aggregation and filtering at the source or within Tableau to reduce the number of rows processed and stored [10]ㅤ[15]ㅤ[16]ㅤ.
Utilize Shared Data Sources:
Employ shared data sources across multiple workbooks to avoid creating redundant copies of the same data [10]ㅤ[15]ㅤ[16]ㅤ.
Increase Folder Size:
Coordinate with infrastructure or storage teams to formally increase the allocated size of the TableauShare folder to 5GB as requested [5]ㅤ. This should be the final step after attempting optimization.
